summary: "A fast CSV command line toolkit written in Rust"
description: |
  xsv is a command line program for indexing, slicing, analyzing, 
  splitting and joining CSV files. Commands should be simple, 
  fast and composable:
    Simple tasks should be easy.
    Performance trade offs should be exposed in the CLI interface.
    Composition should not come at the expense of performance.
