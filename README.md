# `xsv` is now unmaintained

In lieu of `xsv`, I'd recommend either
[qsv](https://github.com/dathere/qsv)
or
[xan](https://github.com/medialab/xan).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


xsv is a command line program for indexing, slicing, analyzing, splitting
and joining CSV files. Commands should be simple, fast and composable:

1. Simple tasks should be easy.
2. Performance trade offs should be exposed in the CLI interface.
3. Composition should not come at the expense of performance.

This README contains information on how to
[install `xsv`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv#installation), in addition to
a quick tour of several commands.

### Available commands

* **cat** - Concatenate CSV files by row or by column.
* **count** - Count the rows in a CSV file. (Instantaneous with an index.)
* **fixlengths** - Force a CSV file to have same-length records by either
  padding or truncating them.
* **flatten** - A flattened view of CSV records. Useful for viewing one record
  at a time. e.g., `xsv slice -i 5 data.csv | xsv flatten`.
* **fmt** - Reformat CSV data with different delimiters, record terminators
  or quoting rules. (Supports ASCII delimited data.)
* **frequency** - Build frequency tables of each column in CSV data. (Uses
  parallelism to go faster if an index is present.)
* **headers** - Show the headers of CSV data. Or show the intersection of all
  headers between many CSV files.
* **index** - Create an index for a CSV file. This is very quick and provides
  constant time indexing into the CSV file.
* **input** - Read CSV data with exotic quoting/escaping rules.
* **join** - Inner, outer and cross joins. Uses a simple hash index to make it
  fast.
* **partition** - Partition CSV data based on a column value.
* **sample** - Randomly draw rows from CSV data using reservoir sampling (i.e.,
  use memory proportional to the size of the sample).
* **reverse** - Reverse order of rows in CSV data.
* **search** - Run a regex over CSV data. Applies the regex to each field
  individually and shows only matching rows.
* **select** - Select or re-order columns from CSV data.
* **slice** - Slice rows from any part of a CSV file. When an index is present,
  this only has to parse the rows in the slice (instead of all rows leading up
  to the start of the slice).
* **sort** - Sort CSV data.
* **split** - Split one CSV file into many CSV files of N chunks.
* **stats** - Show basic types and statistics of each column in the CSV file.
  (i.e., mean, standard deviation, median, range, etc.)
* **table** - Show aligned output of any CSV data using
  [elastic tabstops](https://github.com/BurntSushi/tabwriter).

#### Common commands options
```
    -h, --help             Display this message
    -d, --delimiter <arg>  The field delimiter for reading CSV data.
                           Must be a single character. (default: ,)
```

**Examples**

File delimited with comma:

`xsv headers -d ',' data_with_comma.csv`

File delimited with semicolon:

`xsv headers -d ';' data_with_semic.csv`

File delimited with tab:

`xsv headers -d '\t' data_with_tab.csv`

### A whirlwind tour

Let's say you're playing with some of the data from the
[Data Science Toolkit](https://github.com/petewarden/dstkdata), which contains
several CSV files. Maybe you're interested in the population counts of each
city in the world. So grab the data and start examining it:

```bash
$ curl -LO https://burntsushi.net/stuff/worldcitiespop.csv
$ xsv headers worldcitiespop.csv
1   Country
2   City
3   AccentCity
4   Region
5   Population
6   Latitude
7   Longitude
```

The next thing you might want to do is get an overview of the kind of data that
appears in each column. The `stats` command will do this for you:

```bash
$ xsv stats worldcitiespop.csv --everything | xsv table
field       type     min            max            min_length  max_length  mean          stddev         median     mode         cardinality

```

The `xsv table` command takes any CSV data and formats it into aligned columns
using [elastic tabstops](https://github.com/BurntSushi/tabwriter). You'll
notice that it even gets alignment right with respect to Unicode characters.

So, this command takes about 12 seconds to run on my machine, but we can speed
it up by creating an index and re-running the command:

```bash
$ xsv index worldcitiespop.csv
$ xsv stats worldcitiespop.csv --everything | xsv table
...
```

Which cuts it down to about 8 seconds on my machine. (And creating the index
takes less than 2 seconds.)

Notably, the same type of "statistics" command in another
[CSV command line toolkit](https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/)
takes about 2 minutes to produce similar statistics on the same data set.

Creating an index gives us more than just faster statistics gathering. It also
makes slice operations extremely fast because *only the sliced portion* has to
be parsed. For example, let's say you wanted to grab the last 10 records:

```bash
$ xsv count worldcitiespop.csv
3173958
$ xsv slice worldcitiespop.csv -s 3173948 | xsv table
Country  City               AccentCity         Region  Population  Latitude     Longitude

zw       zizalisari         Zizalisari         04                  -17.7588889  31.0105556
zw       zuzumba            Zuzumba            06                  -20.0333333  27.9333333

```

These commands are *instantaneous* because they run in time and memory
proportional to the size of the slice (which means they will scale to
arbitrarily large CSV data).

Switching gears a little bit, you might not always want to see every column in
the CSV data. In this case, maybe we only care about the country, city and
population. So let's take a look at 10 random rows:

```bash
$ xsv select Country,AccentCity,Population worldcitiespop.csv \
  | xsv sample 10 \
  | xsv table
Country  AccentCity       Population
cn       Guankoushang
za       Klipdrift
ma       Ouled Hammou
fr       Les Gravues
la       Ban Phadèng
de       Lüdenscheid      80045
qa       Umm ash Shubrum
bd       Panditgoan
us       Appleton
ua       Lukashenkivske
```

Whoops! It seems some cities don't have population counts. How pervasive is
that?

```bash
$ xsv frequency worldcitiespop.csv --limit 5
field,value,count
Country,cn,238985
Country,ru,215938
Country,id,176546
Country,us,141989

Longitude,23.8,484
Longitude,23.2,477
Longitude,23.05,476
Longitude,25.3,474
Longitude,23.1,459
```

(The `xsv frequency` command builds a frequency table for each column in the
CSV data. This one only took 5 seconds.)

So it seems that most cities do not have a population count associated with
them at all. No matter—we can adjust our previous command so that it only
shows rows with a population count:

```bash
$ xsv search -s Population '[0-9]' worldcitiespop.csv \
  | xsv select Country,AccentCity,Population \
  | xsv sample 10 \
  | xsv table
Country  AccentCity       Population

es       Puerto Real      36946

bg       Sliven           94252
gb       Leatherhead      43544
```

Erk. Which country is `at`? No clue, but the Data Science Toolkit has a CSV
file called `countrynames.csv`. Let's grab it and do a join so we can see which
countries these are:

```bash
curl -LO https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/063cb470e56e64e98cf1/raw/98e2589b801f6ca3ff900b01a87fbb7452eb35c7/countrynames.csv

gb       Leatherhead      43544       GB      Great Britain | UK | England | Scotland | Wales | Northern Ireland | United Kingdom
```

Whoops, now we have two columns called `Country` and an `Abbrev` column that we
no longer need. This is easy to fix by re-ordering columns with the `xsv
select` command:

```bash
$ xsv join --no-case  Country sample.csv Abbrev countrynames.csv \
  | xsv select 'Country[1],AccentCity,Population' \
  | xsv table
Country                                                                              AccentCity       Population

Perhaps we can do this with the original CSV data? Indeed we can—because
joins in `xsv` are fast.

```bash
$ xsv join --no-case Abbrev countrynames.csv Country worldcitiespop.csv \
  | xsv select '!Abbrev,Country[1]' \
  > worldcitiespop_countrynames.csv
$ xsv sample 10 worldcitiespop_countrynames.csv | xsv table

The `!Abbrev,Country[1]` syntax means, "remove the `Abbrev` column and remove
the second occurrence of the `Country` column." Since we joined with
`countrynames.csv` first, the first `Country` name (fully expanded) is now
included in the CSV data.

This `xsv join` command takes about 7 seconds on my machine. The performance
comes from constructing a very simple hash index of one of the CSV data files
given. The `join` command does an inner join by default, but it also has left,
right and full outer join support too.


### Installation

Binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS are available [from Github](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv/releases/latest).

If you're a **macOS Homebrew** user, then you can install xsv
from homebrew-core:

```
$ brew install xsv
```

If you're a **macOS MacPorts** user, then you can install xsv
from the [official ports](https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&substr=xsv):

```
$ sudo port install xsv
```

If you're a **Nix/NixOS** user, you can install xsv from nixpkgs:

```
$ nix-env -i xsv
```

Alternatively, you can compile from source by
[installing Cargo](https://crates.io/install)
([Rust's](https://www.rust-lang.org/) package manager)
and installing `xsv` using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install xsv
```

Compiling from this repository also works similarly:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv
cd xsv
cargo build --release
```

Compilation will probably take a few minutes depending on your machine. The
binary will end up in `./target/release/xsv`.


### Benchmarks

I've compiled some [very rough
benchmarks](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv/blob/master/BENCHMARKS.md) of
various `xsv` commands.


### Motivation

Here are several valid criticisms of this project:

1. You shouldn't be working with CSV data because CSV is a terrible format.
2. If your data is gigabytes in size, then CSV is the wrong storage type.
3. Various SQL databases provide all of the operations available in `xsv` with
   more sophisticated indexing support. And the performance is a zillion times
   better.

I'm sure there are more criticisms, but the impetus for this project was a 40GB
CSV file that was handed to me. I was tasked with figuring out the shape of the
data inside of it and coming up with a way to integrate it into our existing
system. It was then that I realized that every single CSV tool I knew about was
woefully inadequate. They were just too slow or didn't provide enough
flexibility. (Another project I had comprised of a few dozen CSV files. They
were smaller than 40GB, but they were each supposed to represent the same kind
of data. But they all had different column and unintuitive column names. Useful
CSV inspection tools were critical here—and they had to be reasonably fast.)

The key ingredients for helping me with my task were indexing, random sampling,
searching, slicing and selecting columns. All of these things made dealing with
40GB of CSV data a bit more manageable (or dozens of CSV files).

Getting handed a large CSV file *once* was enough to launch me on this quest.
From conversations I've had with others, CSV data files this large don't seem
to be a rare event. Therefore, I believe there is room for a tool that has a
hope of dealing with data that large.


### Naming collision

This project is unrelated to another similar project with the same name:
https://mj.ucw.cz/sw/xsv/
